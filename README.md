# Regression
Constructing a multi-layer perceptron to regress synthetic data
In this code, we construct a multi-layer perception with pytorch to regress linear data present in fort.100 file. This data has three columns, time, x and y. There is no vacancy in the data set. 
This code is able to regress other nonlinear coupled dataset too. I will upload them in future.
